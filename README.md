# Week-9-Test

**Name at least two things to check for debugging for when your code isn’t working (bonus points for more then two).**

[1: unfinished tags 2: misspelled words 3: Undefined variables 4: Mismatched functions ]


**Why won’t this work? In your HTML: `<input class=”.some-element” type=“text” />` In your Javascript: `$(“.another-element”).val();`**

[The tags don't match. It needs to either both be .some-element or .another-element.]


**What’s the relationship between JavaScript and jQuery?**

[JavaScript is the stuff that makes up the base of whatever you're making, and jQuery adds stuff onto it?]


**What does `var name = $(‘.name-field’).val();` do?**

[Does that put up a text field for the user to type in? Or is that saving the data from the text field?]



**How do we make sure an element is hidden when the page is first loaded? Hint: you don’t need any javascript! How do we then unhide that element using javascript?**

[do yo put a #Hide?]


**What’s the difference between `$(‘#myElement’)` and `$(‘.myElement’)`?**

[The # is an id and the . means it is a variable]
